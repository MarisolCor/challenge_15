# Challenge_15
## Mapping
### In this Challenge, I created a visualization of earthquakes in the last 7 days using data from The United States Geological Survey (USGS). I also added layers to visualize tectonic plates, orogens, satellite imagery, and street maps.
In general, we can see that the majority of earthquakes occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates.
